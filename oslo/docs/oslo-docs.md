# What is OSLO?
*Offstack Language Overrides*, or **OSLO** provides a way for offstack web components to be able to integrate with language overrides in the LMS. Overrides allow changing the displayed text of almost any term on the platform. For example, if you want to change all occurrences of "Assignments" to "Dropbox" you can do that in the language management tool using language overrides.


# Setting up OSLO for your Webcomponent

  1. [Use Serge for translations](#use-serge-for-translations)
  2. [Follow the OSLO langterm naming convention](#follow-the-oslo-langterm-naming-convention)
  3. [Include your web component within the BSI project](#include-your-web-component-within-the-bsi-project)
  4. [Create a mixin to expose the `localize()` method](#create-a-mixin-to-expose-the-localize-method)
## Use Serge for translations
For more information on how to implement serge within your web component please read [Serge-Localize](https://docs.dev.d2l/index.php/Serge-Localize)
## Follow the OSLO langterm naming convention
The LAIM tool used in the LMS can only accept a set of valid characters. Currently OSLO will accept any character and convert characters not supported by the LAIM tool into their equivalent Unicode representation `\uXXXX"`.


> âš  Using invalid LAIM tool characters is not advised because it causes problems when searching for the langterm using the language management tool. Searching will not return a result when using the original character that was parsed.

To mitigate these problems, the following format is recommended:
```
{grandparent}\{parent}\camelCaseTermName
```
`\` can be used to provide hierarchy to term names and allow a grouping of related terms

**Valid characters include:**  
`\` `-` `_` `:` `@` `A-Z` `a-z` `0-9`

**Alternative valid formats:**
```
{grandparent}\{parent}\snake_case_term_name
{grandparent}\{parent}\kebab-case-term-name
{grandparent}:{parent}:camelCaseTermName
```

**Validation**  
If you would like to test if your term name is valid visit https://regexr.com/ and use the following regex:
```
^[a-zA-Z0-9\\:_-@]*$
```

## Include your web component within the BSI project
This can be done following the [docs](https://github.com/Brightspace/brightspace-integration/blob/master/docs/web-components.md) on the BSI repo.
Specifically your component must do the following step:
> **Lang Terms**
> 
> Optionally, if your component has lang terms managed by Serge.io, add an entry to the .serge-mapping.json file:
> ```
> {
>   ...
>   "my-component": "my-component/my-component.serge.json"
>   ...
> }
> ```

## Create a mixin to expose the `localize()` method

For existing web components the `localize()` method would have been exposed when following the [`localize-mixin`](https://github.com/BrightspaceUI/core/blob/master/mixins/localize-mixin.md) documentation from `@Brightspace-UI/core`. In this case a few things will need to be changed.
- Add `resolveOverridesFunc()` to `getLocalizeResources`
- return `getLocalizeOverrideResources()` inside `if` block
- return `getLocalizeOverrideResources()` inside at end of function

This will need to be done for each unique collection name you wish to have. (Each serge object will result in a new collection name)

```javascript
import { LocalizeMixin } from '@brightspace-ui/core/mixins/localize-mixin.js';
import { getLocalizeOverrideResources } from '@brightspace-ui/core/helpers/getLocalizeResources.js'; // NEWLY ADDED FOR OSLO

export const ComponentLocalizeMixin = superclass => class extends LocalizeMixin(superclass) {

    static async getLocalizeResources(langs) {


        function resolveOverridesFunc() {                                                            // NEWLY ADDED FOR OSLO
            return 'your-npm-package-name\\your-object-serge-name'; // Collection Name               // NEWLY ADDED FOR OSLO     
        }                                                                                            // NEWLY ADDED FOR OSLO
        
        let translations;
        for await (const lang of langs) {
            switch (lang) {
                case 'en':
                    translations = await import('./locales/en.js');
                        break;
                case 'fr':
                    translations = await import('./locales/fr.js');
                    break;
                }
            if (translations && translations.default) {
                return await getLocalizeOverrideResources(                                           // NEWLY ADDED FOR OSLO                              
                    lang,                                                                            // NEWLY ADDED FOR OSLO
                    translations.default,                                                            // NEWLY ADDED FOR OSLO
                    resolveOverridesFunc                                                             // NEWLY ADDED FOR OSLO
                );                                                                                   // NEWLY ADDED FOR OSLO
            }
        }
		translations = await import('../lang/en.js');

        return await getLocalizeOverrideResources(                                                   // NEWLY ADDED FOR OSLO
            'en',                                                                                    // NEWLY ADDED FOR OSLO
            translations.default,                                                                    // NEWLY ADDED FOR OSLO
            resolveOverridesFunc                                                                     // NEWLY ADDED FOR OSLO
        );                                                                                           // NEWLY ADDED FOR OSLO
    }
}
```

Your component would then use this mixin and have access to the `localize()` method

```javascript
class MyComponent extends ComponentLocalizeMixin(LitElement) {
    render() {
        return html`<p>${this.localize('hello', {firstName: 'Mary'})}</p>`;
    }
}
```

## Hiding a collection

TODO

In some cases, you may want to temporarily hide collections from appearing in the language management UI without deleting the terms or collection from the database. In this scenario you can add these collections to [this blocked collections list](https://github.com/Brightspace/lms/blob/master/lp/framework/core/D2L/lang/Provider/BlockedCollections.cs) and they will be hidden from the users in the Language Management UI.
